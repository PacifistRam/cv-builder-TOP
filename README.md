# # CV Builder By Odin Project

This project is built as part of the React curriculum to gain a basic understanding of components and state management using the `useState` hook. Here are the key learnings from this project:

1. **Lifting of States to Parent Component**: Understanding how to manage state in parent components and pass it down to child components efficiently.
   
2. **Setting Up a Single State for Multiple Form Fields**: Utilizing a single state object to manage multiple form fields, simplifying state management and reducing redundancy.
   
3. **Managing State with Empty Arrays**: Implementing empty array states to dynamically accept and display multiple objects, such as education details or work experience, enabling the creation of multiple components.

CSS styling is handled by Tailwind CSS, with the addition of some shadcn/UI components for enhanced styling and functionality.

## Work to be Done

- **Styling Improvement**: The CV display section as well the data collection form needs proper styling to enhance its visual appeal and readability.
  
- **Code Formatting**: Regular code formatting, including CSS, is required to maintain consistency and readability across the project.

By addressing these tasks, the project will be polished and ready for presentation, providing a comprehensive CV building experience for users.
